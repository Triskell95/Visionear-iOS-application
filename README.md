Visionear is a system to help blind people to have a description of an image. 

The user has a helmet equipped by a microphone, a headphone and a camera to recognise objects, ask questions about these objects and listen to the answers. All the devices are linked to a Raspberry Pi and communicate with a mobile phone application (here with an iOS application). Also available for Windows Phone. 

This app is developed for an internship project in KMUTT, Bangkok (Thailand), extending the Visionear Project, developed by 4 KMUTT students (Pam, Jump, Nick & Diar), to iOS devices.
